Detective Nicola Riley, newly promoted to the position, awakens for another day. She gets ready while trying not to disturb her fiance, George.  "Only another week!" she muttered excitedly to herself. "Crap!"

<<timed 10s>>George wakes up.<</timed>>

In his half-awake state, George jokes, "Why are you trying to be so secretive?"

"I'm a detective. It's part of our job to be secretive!"
"So secretive that you don't have time to say goodbye?"
"Oh fine", Nicola says, "but you have to get that silly head of yours back to sleep."

Nicola arrives at the Police Station. Filled with all the typical traits that come with it: bad coffee, corruption and an angry chief.

Though Nicola is a detective, she still has to work in the bullpen: A large room with 16 desks, all with small partitions allowing for two people to work at a desk.  "The detectives at least get the "quiet" corner" she thinks optimistically.

:: Station_2 {"position":"975,100","size":"100,100"}
Nicola looks around. "I might as well ingest some of this terrible dark liquid known as coffee."

By the coffee pot is Kim, the only other female detective. Kim is 5 years Nicola's senior in both career and life. They have almost nothing in common besides the job and an impending marriage. Beyond the usual morning pleasantries, conversation is a no-go.

Dr. Asher continued.
"I compared this years current stats to each year in the previous decade and quite frankly, it makes little sense."

<<timed 5s>>Nicola, still angry and now baffled, asks "I assume George is part your stats?"<</timed>>

<<timed 9s>>"Yes. So is Joseph Howard."<</timed>>

<<timed 12s>>"You gave me that?!" Nicola yelled.<</timed>>

<<timed 16s>>"Sorry. I was hoping you might see a connection yourself."<</timed>>

<<timed 20s>>Outraged, Nicola stormed out of the Doctor's office, slamming the double doors as hard as she could.

"Yes. It's rather perplexing isn't it?" Dr. Asher liked rhetorical questions. Nicola thought it made her seem cocky.

<<timed 5s>>Dr. Asher continued "I managed to get the rope from five of the hangings. I got my assistants to run some tests on each of the ropes. This is where it gets a litte weird."<</timed>>

<<timed 13s>>Nicola's eyebrows raised.<</timed>>

<<timed 15s>>"All the rope is made entirely out of organic materials, no synthetics apart from a cap on an end of each rope. We've found that each of these ropes are the same age with a 3 day margin of error."<</timed>>

"It started a little while ago. Since the 20th of April, there's been a massive upturn in suicides."

<<timed 4s>>Nicola swallowed loudly.<</timed>>

<<timed 7s>>"Particularly in unexpected suicides where the item of choice is-"<</timed>>

<<timed 10s>>"A noose?" Nicola interrupted.<</timed>>

<<timed 13s>>"Well, to be precise, rope. Nooses can be made from any adequately long bit of cable. 98% of suicides since the 20th have been exclusively rope."<</timed>>

Nicola slumped herself against the wall.

<<timed 6s>>"Pull yourself together, it's been ages."<</timed>>

<<timed 10s>>Just like a light-switch, Nicola composed herself. She wiped the few tears from her eyes and walked back into the Doctor's office. She sits down.

"If you thought that was weird, prepare yourself."

<<timed 5s>>Nicola had never seen Dr. Asher so excited. "I guess her education is finally paying off here." she joked to herself.<</timed>>

<<timed 10s>>Dr. Asher continued. "On the noosed part of the rope, right at the part that would be situated behind the victims neck, we found a tiny amount of a rather thick liquid."<</timed>>

"Yes I did."

Dr. Asher was always straight to the point. Never any small-talk, unless truly necessary.

"I've had this feeling, hunch if you will, about this for a little while now."

"Go on." Nicola instructed.

"Please take a seat first."

"The point is, is that we found this on all five ropes at exactly the same place. Initially, we thought that it was something from the scene of one of the hangings. But after a second rope had it, we had to test the other three."

<<timed 5s>>"What is the liquid made of?"<</timed>>

<<timed 7s>>"It's hard to say. It's more or less a combination of things. High-level narcotics and morphine to put it simply."<</timed>>

Nicola walks towards the staircase.
She has a look around.

"Hmm. Everyone's gone. That was quick."

She makes her way down the tiny staircase and through the double doors to the coroner's office.

Dr. Asher is sitting at her desk. A somewhat androgynous, middle-aged woman with a wall filled with diplomas and honours of various kinds. Nicola still wonders why she stuck with being a coroner.

[["You wanted to show me something Doctor?"|Coroner_2]]

Nicola and Connor enter the interrogation room to see Frank Johns.  He was a short, grey haired man. An extremely pale complexion, as if he hadn't seen the sun in weeks. Upon his face was a seemingly permanent sorrowful expression.

Nicola sat down on the designated interrogators chair. Connor decided to watch from the corner of the room.

<<linkreplace "'So, I'm sure you know why you're here. Care to explain to me what happened on the twenty-first of August?'">>Frank slumped forwards with his head in hands. "I didn't mean to. It was an accident." he said between breating and crying. "She said that she was leaving. She...she...she said I was too much."
<<linkreplace "'Too much what?'">>
"I don't know." he screamed. "I said she couldn't leave and..."
<<linkreplace "'And what?'">>
"She said she could over my dead body. I thought she was speaking out of anger until she came at me with a knife."
<<linkreplace "'Are you saying you killed her in self-defence?'">>
"Yes. No. I'm not sure. I guess so."

<<timed 8s>>"No that's okay. Just be quiet for a few seconds."<</timed>>

Patrol officers were on duty on 13/9/13 in the area of the Branford apartment complex. One of them, Officer Mel Key, noted a pair of people behaving strangely.  The officers went to investigate only to have the people run away.

Upon a brief investigation of the scene they found various illegal narcotics, a pistol and a cloth soaked in blood.

On testing the blood, it belongs to no-one on record. Further testing shows it would belong to a girl, aged between 8 and 12.

No girls matching the criteria have been reported missing or injured around the time.

On 21/9/13, Joseph Howard made a distress call saying that his 11 year old daughter, Jessica, had vanished. 

On 22/9/13, Joseph Howard was found hanged in his home.
